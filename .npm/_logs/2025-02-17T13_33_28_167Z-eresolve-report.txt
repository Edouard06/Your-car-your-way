# npm resolution error report

While resolving: olympic-games-starter@0.0.0
Found: @angular/compiler-cli@18.2.13
node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli
  dev @angular/compiler-cli@"^18.0.3" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @angular/compiler-cli@"^19.0.0" from @angular-devkit/build-angular@19.1.7
node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular
  dev @angular-devkit/build-angular@"^19.1.7" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
